The scatter plot shows that as long as a country has a high life expectancy, they will have a low infant mortality rate. There is a negative correlation between the two variables.

**C) A world map identifying each country according to its infant mortality rate and life expectancy.**

Countries(each point) with a high infant mortality rate will have a larger size and a redder color.
